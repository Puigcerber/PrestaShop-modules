# HolidayAlert PrestaShop module

During Christmas time a client wanted to show an alert to his costumers because the shop was going to be closed during the holidays. So I developed this really simple PrestaShop module that shows a message in the top of the shop or in the cart page.

## Setup

### Installation

1. Copy the holidayalert folder to your modules folder.
2. Log into your PrestaShop dashboard.
3. Hover over the Modules tab and select the Modules option.
4. Search for **Holiday alert** and click Install.

### Configuration

* You can choose among four classes to colour the box: success (green), info (blue), warning (yellow) and danger (red).
* You can edit the displayed message.

### Hooks

* displayTop: display the alert box at the top of every page.
* displayShoppingCart: display the alert box in the sopping cart page.
