# PrestaShop-modules

As a freelancer I had to develop some PrestaShop modules and here I'm open sourcing them as they might be useful for other people.

All of them comply with PrestaShop's coding standars and have been [validated](http://validator.prestashop.com/).

## Current modules

* **HolidayAlert**: Set a message to alert your clients that the shop is on holiday.
* **UploadOrderToFTP**: Save every order to a text file and upload it to a remote FTP server.
